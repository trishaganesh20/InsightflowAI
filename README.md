**InsightFlow — AI-Powered Business Analytics Assistant**

InsightFlow is an end-to-end analytics application that transforms natural language business questions into SQL queries, executes them safely on a MySQL database, and visualizes results through interactive dashboards.
This project was designed to simulate a real-world business analytics environment — combining data engineering, analytics, and AI to support faster, data-driven decision making.

**Why I Built This:**
  As a Management Information Systems graduate, I wanted to build something that reflects how modern analytics teams actually operate.
  The goal was to bridge the gap between business questions and technical execution.


**What This Project Demonstrates**
This project highlights my ability to:

- Design relational database schemas  
- Generate large-scale synthetic datasets  
- Build secure database connections  
- Validate SQL for safety  
- Integrate OpenAI-based LLMs into an analytics workflow  
- Develop interactive data apps using Streamlit  
- Translate business needs into technical solutions  

**Languages and Tools**
- Python  
- MySQL  
- Streamlit  
- OpenAI API  
- Plotly  
- Pandas  
- Faker (synthetic data generation)  

**Environment**
- MySQL Workbench  
- VS Code  
- GitHub  
- macOS  

**Key Features**
- Natural Language → SQL
Users can ask business questions, and the app generates optimized SQL queries using an OpenAI-powered model.

- SQL Safety Layer
Before execution, queries pass through a validation system that blocks destructive commands such as:
- DROP  
- DELETE  
- UPDATE  
- ALTER  
This ensures a secure analytics environment.

- Automated Data Generation
A custom data generator simulates a production-scale business database including:
- 5,000 customers  
- 60,000 orders  
- 120,000 order items  
- subscriptions  
- support tickets  
This allowed me to test realistic analytics scenarios.

- Interactive Dashboards
Query results are automatically visualized using Plotly, enabling faster interpretation of trends and performance metrics.
